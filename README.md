# Vistock POS System - Test Cases & Testing Documentation

## Overview

**Vistock** is a comprehensive Point of Sale (POS) system designed to streamline the management of products, sales, purchases, inventory, and more. It allows businesses to handle various types of products such as digital, standard, service, and combo products, and supports key features like barcode generation, stock requests, transfers, and reports.

## What I Have Performed

### 1. **Manual Testing**

I conducted extensive manual testing to ensure the functionality and usability of the Vistock POS system. The following modules were tested:

- **Product Management**: Creation, editing, and deletion of standard, digital, service, and combo products.
- **Brand & Category Management**: Testing brand and category creation and editing.
- **Warehouse Management**: Verifying warehouse creation and stock adjustments.
- **Stock Management**: Ensuring proper functionality of stock counts, transfers, and stock requests.
- **Purchase & Sales**: Testing purchase creation, sales processes, and associated features like gift cards.
- **User Interface (UI) Testing**: Checking for any UI anomalies, ensuring components are functional and free of errors.

### 2. **API Testing**

I performed API testing to ensure the backend services of the Vistock POS system are working as expected. The testing focused on:

- **API Endpoint Verification**: Testing all relevant endpoints for correct response status, error handling, and data integrity.
- **Functional Testing**: Ensuring APIs perform the intended operations such as creating, updating, and deleting products, managing sales and purchases, and handling stock-related requests.
- **Data Validation**: Verifying that data passed through the APIs is consistent and accurate.
- **Performance Testing**: Ensuring APIs perform efficiently under load and return responses within acceptable time limits.

## Test Case Results

The tests were executed, and the results were categorized as:

- **PASS**: 153
- **FAIL**: 29
- **NOT EXECUTED**: 0
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: 25

### Notable Issues Found

Some issues encountered during testing include:

- **Transfer Failures**: While transfer requests are created, actual transfers fail due to a backend issue.
- **Purchase Editing**: Editing purchases and setting product count to zero results in unexpected behavior.
- **Gift Card Logic**: The gift card creation page failed to import customer group data correctly.

### Recommendations

I have documented all issues found along with suggestions for improvements in the test case report. These include enhancing API handling, improving UI components, and fixing backend issues related to transfers and stock management.
